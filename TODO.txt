NULL Hunter
TODO
- For the large file - Read in chunks instead of a character at a time and reduce I/O
- Unit test: Utilize different suites to avoid recreating large files with each test
- Report offsets of all the segments (regardless of the lengths)
- Debug build (with debug printfs)
- Ratio: Show total NULLs to total file size ratio
- Ratio: Show longest NULL segment size to file size ratio
- Inform if the longest NULL segment is at the very end of the file

WISHLIST
- Autoconf/Automake: configure file

DONE
- Report the offset of the longest NULL segment
- Support multiple longest NULL segments of equal length
- Github action to autorun tests on push
- Move unittest files to a separate directory
- Coverage: Get insight into test coverage
- Support big file sizes
